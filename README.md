# **Implementing and Analyzing K-Means Clustering on Synthetic Data**
This project uses the K-Means clustering algorithm on a synthetic multi-modal dataset to find natural groupings. The number of clusters is determined by the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score. The results are then visualized and explained to show understanding of unsupervised learning and cluster assessment using NumPy and plots.
